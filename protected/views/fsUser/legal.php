The arbitration decision will generally be final and binding.  Other rights that either of us would have if we went to court may not be available.<br />

		Arbitration Procedures for the Online Agreement<br />
		Either of us may choose to resolve disputes regarding the Online Agreement through arbitration or in small claims court, but no other proceeding or court may be used by either party and the choices of arbitration or small claims court are exclusive.  This document describes the arbitration process and the limitations placed on both of us in arbitration.<br />
		ARBITRATION/WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  Arbitration is a method of resolving claims and disputes between parties without having to file a lawsuit in court.  Parties in an arbitration present their claims and disputes to a neutral third person - an arbitrator - instead of a judge or jury.  Arbitration is the way both of us will resolve any Covered Claims under the Online Agreement, except as described below in the Alternatives to Arbitration.<br />
		CONDITION TO BEGINNING ARBITRATON.  We prefer to resolve any dispute directly with you.  Before starting arbitration, the party who has the claim or dispute shall notify the other party in writing, describe the dispute in reasonable detail, and then give the other party 30 days to resolve the matter.  If this process does not resolve the dispute, then either of us may start arbitration.<br />
		CLAIMS COVERED BY ARBITRATION.  All Covered Claims in the Online Agreement must be submitted to arbitration, including without limitation (a) those based in contract; tort; state or federal statutes, regulations or ordinances; state or federal common law; state or federal constitutional law; and (b) those seeking any form of equitable or declaratory relief or money damages.  Any questions about whether a claim or dispute is a Covered Claim subject to arbitration shall be resolved by interpreting these Arbitration Procedures in the broadest way they may be enforced, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") and the terms of these Arbitration Procedures. <br />
		COVERED CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES.  These Arbitration Procedures also encompass any Covered Claims between you or any other liable party and our employees, representatives, or affiliated companies, any other companies that provided or offered any products or services covered by the Online Agreement, and any other person or entity that could be jointly liable with you or us if a Covered Claim is successfully pursued.<br />
		ALTERNATIVE TO ARBITRATION.  Instead of proceeding to arbitration, either of us have the option to pursue a Covered Claim in a Small Claims Court (or the equivalent) so long as (1) the Covered Claim remains in that court, and (2) is made solely on behalf of you or us, whichever is making the Claim.  If either of us files a Covered Claim in a Small Claims Court, and the other party files a counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party complaint seeking injunctive relief, damages in an amount greater that the jurisdictional limit of the Small Claims Court of to obtain relief on behalf of other persons, then neither of us will have waived any arbitration rights and either of us may require the other's individual claims be arbitrated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Arbitration Procedures.  In that event, then the dispute must proceed in arbitration if it proceeds at all and may not be maintained in any other forum.<br />
		ARBITRATION FORUM.  The arbitration between us will be conducted by the following Arbitration Administrator:<br />
		American Arbitration Association ("AAA")<br />
		333 Madison Avenue, Floor 10<br />
		New York, NY 10017-4605<br />
		www.adr.org<br />
		If the AAA is unable or unwilling to serve as Administrator, then whoever initiates the arbitration may chose an Administrator from a list maintained by WILDFIRE DEFENSE SYSTEMS, INC.  You may contact us or the Administrator to obtain information about arbitration and to obtain the Administrator's arbitration rules ("Arbitration Rules"), as well as any claim forms and fee schedules.  We will also provide that information to you if you ask for it.<br />
		STARTING ARBITRATION.  Both of us must follow the Administrator's Arbitration Rules to begin an arbitration.  If you choose to begin arbitration, you must send arbitration notices to us at WILDFIRE DEFENSE SYSTEMS, INC. General Counsel, c/o Boone Karlberg, P.C., P.O. Box 9199, Missoula, MT 59807.  If we choose to begin arbitration, we must send notices to you at your last physical address contained in our records.  We both have the right to be represented by an attorney in the arbitration proceedings.<br />
		SELECTION OF ARBITRATOR.  The Administrator maintains lists of approved arbitrators.  The Administrator shall provide both of us a list of seven (7) possible arbitrators.  We each have an opportunity to strike three (3) persons from that list.  You will make the first strike, and then we will both alternate making strikes after that.  After the last strike, the remaining person shall serve as the arbitrator.<br />
		COSTS OF ARBITRATION.  The Administrator charges certain fees in connection with arbitration proceedings ("Arbitration Fees").  We will pay any Arbitration Fees for any Covered Claim we file against you.  If you file a Covered Claim and cannot afford to pay the Arbitration Fees, and if the Administrator determines that it will not waive any or all of the Arbitration Fees, then at your request we will advance those fees on your behalf.  At the end, the arbitrator will ultimately decide who will be responsible for paying any fees.  Unless inconsistent with applicable law or the Administrator's rules, the parties will pay for their own arbitration costs (including fees and expenses of their own attorneys, experts, and witnesses), regardless of which party prevails in the arbitration.<br />
		LOCATION OF THE ARBITRATION.  Regardless of how the arbitration arises, whether by choice of one of the parties or by way of a motion filed in court, the arbitration shall take place within the State of Montana.  If we both agree, all or a portion of the arbitration proceedings may be conducted by telephone conference.<br />
		CONDUCT OF PROCEEDINGS.  The arbitrator must follow the Administrator's Arbitration Rules in effect at the time of the arbitration, unless they conflict with the terms of this Agreement.  The arbitrator must (a) apply substantive law consistent with the FAA, (b) recognize and enforce all applicable statutes of limitation, and (c) honor all privileges recognized at law (including without limitation the attorney/client privilege and the attorney work product doctrine).  The arbitrator's findings, reasoning, decision, and award shall be set forth in writing and must be based upon the laws governing this Agreement.<br />
		LIMITATIONS ON PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER RIGHTS.  The arbitrator shall be restricted to resolving only the Covered Claims between you and us.  Unless we both consent in writing, the arbitrator shall NOT have the authority to conduct any class-wide arbitration proceedings.  The arbitrator may not consolidate or join together any Covered Claims we have against each other with any claims or disputes either of us may have with other persons or account holders, unless we both consent in writing.  You may not pursue any type of collective action or class action us in court or in arbitration.  You will not have the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any Covered Claim as to which arbitration has been elected.  If one or more of the above limitations on proceedings and other rights is deemed to be unenforceable or interpreted to not prevent a collective or class action, then such collective or class action shall proceed in a court of law and not in arbitration.<br />
		LIMITATION OF ARBITRATOR'S AUTHORITY.  The arbitrator may award any damages or other relief permitted by applicable substantive law, including punitive damages.  But the arbitrator may award punitive damages only under circumstances where a court of competent jurisdiction could award such damages.  In awarding punitive damages, the arbitrator must abide by all applicable state and federal laws regarding the amount of such damages, and the arbitrator must state the precise amount of any punitive damages award.  Before the decision becomes final, the arbitrator must also conduct a post-award review of any punitive damages, allowing the parties the same procedural rights and using the same standards and guidelines that would apply in a judicial proceeding in the state where the arbitration is located.  Any ruling based on this post-award review must be set forth in writing with a reasoned explanation.  The arbitrator may award injunctive or declaratory relief that would benefit you or us, but the arbitrator may not award injunctive or declaratory relief for the benefit of others who are not named parties to the arbitration proceedings. <br />
		ENFORCEMENT AND APPEAL OF DECISION.  The decision and judgment by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and enforceable in any court having jurisdiction.  The decision will become final and binding after 15 days unless either of us seeks an appeal or review of the decision.  Either of us has the option to appeal the arbitrator's decision to a panel consisting of three new arbitrators who will be selected by the strike process.  These arbitrators will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, will make a decision based on the vote of the majority, and will issue a written decision consistent with all of the previous terms of this Agreement.  Whoever decides to appeal may waive the three-arbitrator appeal process and directly seek judicial review of the arbitrator's decision pursuant to 9 U.S.C. &sect; 10.  The arbitrator's decision (and, if appropriate, the panel's decision) may be judicially reviewed on all grounds set forth in 9 U.S.C. &sect; 10, as well as on the grounds that the decision is manifestly inconsistent with the terms of the Online Agreement or any applicable laws or regulations.<br />
		ENFORCEMENT IN COURT.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either of us from enforcing all rights under these Arbitration Procedures if a Covered Claim is filed in court.<br />
		MISCELLANEOUS.  The transactions between us involve interstate commerce and the FAA governs these Arbitration Procedures.  State arbitration laws and procedures shall not apply to this Agreement.  These Arbitration Procedures shall survive bankruptcy and termination or modification of the Online Agreement.  If either of us does not request arbitration for a Covered Claim, it shall not be considered a waiver of the right to request arbitration for another Covered Claim.  In the event of any conflict between these Arbitration Procedures and any other provision of the Online Agreement (or any earlier version), these Arbitration Procedures shall control.  In the event of any conflict between these Arbitration Procedures and your Product Agreement, the Product Agreement shall control.  These Arbitration Procedures apply to and run to the benefit of your and our successors, assigns, transferees, executors, heirs, and representatives.<br />
		YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT IF EITHER OF US ELECTS TO ARBITRATE A COVERED CLAIM, THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES PRECLUDE BOTH OF US FROM LITIGATING CLAIMS THROUGH COURT OR HAVING A JURY TRIAL ON THAT CLAIM, OR ENGAGING IN PRE-ARBITRATION DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE ARBITRATION RULES.  FURTHER, YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS PERTAINING TO ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO ARBIRTATION.  THE ARBITRATION DECISION WILL GENERALLY BE FINAL AND BINDING.  OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.<br />
