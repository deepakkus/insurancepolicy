        <h3>Windows</h3>
		<b>Select YES if any window on the structure (including a skylight) is single-pane annealed glass or plexiglass.</b>
		<p>Single-pane, annealed windows will fracture, and plexiglass, often used in dome-style skylight windows and light tunnels, will melt, and fail with exposure to moderate radiant heat.A failed or missing window pane will provide a large opening in the structure for flames and embers.</p>
