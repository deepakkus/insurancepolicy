        <h3>Gutters</h3>
		<b>Select YES if an accumulation of debris is present within the gutter or on the gutter guard/screen.</b>
		<p>Gutters can collect debris (leaves, needles, pinecones, small branches), providing a fuel bed for burning embers next to the roof edge and eave fascia. Debris can also collect atop gutter screens or guards.</p>
