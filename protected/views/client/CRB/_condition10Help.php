        <h3>Siding</h3>
		<b>Select YES if the exterior siding or a portion of the exterior siding is a combustible material.</b>
		<p>Combustible siding, such as wood, T1-11, and Masonite, will ignite from exposure to prolonged radiant heat or direct flames. Vinyl siding will melt and burn with minimal exposure to radiant heat. Siding in fair to poor condition will ignite more readily than siding that is well-maintained.</p>
