        <h3>Roof Debris</h3>
		<b>Select YES if there is an accumulation of leaves, needles, pinecones, and/or branches on the roof that provide fuel for burning embers.</b>
		<p>There is an increased risk of flame exposure for complex roofs where debris accumulates against combustible siding, soffits, and/or fascia at intersections with the side of the home, such as dormers.</p>
