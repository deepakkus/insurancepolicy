        <h3>Landscape Vegetation</h3>
		<b>Select YES if vegetation in this zone is overgrown and heavy or has continuity, either horizontal as with an unbroken canopy or vertical as with ladder fuels in which fire can climb from low-growing vegetation to overhanging taller shrubs and trees.</b>
		<p>Substantial or continuous vegetation can carry fire from the edge of the property to the structure or expose the structure to prolonged or intense radiant heat.</p>
