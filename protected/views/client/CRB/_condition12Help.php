        <h3>Attachments</h3>
		<b>Select YES if there is a deck, railing/fence, pergola, trellis, carport, or other combustible structure directly attached to the home siding/roofing. Take a photo of each unique example.</b>
		<p>Often constructed of wood, vinyl, or a wood/plastic composite, these become additional fuels connected to the structure. If ignited, combustible attachments can expose the main structure to prolonged direct flame impingement.</p>
